        'On-Behalf-Of Token Exchange is Okta\'s implementation of RFC 8693, the IETF standard for OAuth 2.0 Token Exchange. The core problem it solves is deceptively simple to state but surprisingly hard to solve correctly: when a service — in the agentic context, an AI agent — needs to call another protected service on a user\'s behalf, the downstream API needs to know both who the user is and that the calling agent was explicitly authorized to act for them. Without a standards-based mechanism for this, teams reach for workarounds: storing the user\'s raw access token inside the agent, running all agent calls under a shared service account, or building custom token-passing schemes. Each of these either breaks the security model or destroys the audit trail.',
        'RFC 8693 defines a new OAuth 2.0 grant type — urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:token-exchange — specifically for this delegation scenario. The requesting party presents an existing token (the user\'s access token, the "subject") and its own identity credential (the agent\'s credential, the "actor"), and the authorization server issues a new token that binds both identities together. The resulting token is not a clone of the user\'s token. It is a distinct, purpose-scoped credential that carries the user\'s identity in the sub claim (so downstream APIs know who authorized the action) and the requesting service app\'s client ID in the cid claim (so downstream APIs know which agent executed it). The token\'s scope and audience can be further constrained relative to the original user token — agents get only what they need for the specific task.',
        'This is the right solution for AI agent delegated access — not service accounts, not client credentials, not raw token forwarding. Service accounts give agents a static machine identity with no per-user context. Client credentials tell the API who the agent is but say nothing about which user authorized the call or what they were permitted to do. Forwarding the user\'s raw token gives the agent the user\'s full set of permissions with no record of delegation. OBO token exchange is the only pattern that produces a verifiable, auditable credential that captures the complete authorization picture: user identity, agent identity, delegated scope, issuance time, and expiry. For any organization building AI agents that touch user data or user-authorized resources, this is not optional infrastructure — it is the foundation of a defensible authorization model.',

      heading: 'The Token Exchange Flow Step-by-Step',
      paragraphs: [
        '!! Technical setup note: to enable token exchange, the service app must have "Token Exchange" checked under Grant type > Advanced in the Okta Admin Console. The subject token must be an access token from an Authorization Code + PKCE flow (not an ID token). You cannot include offline_access or OIDC scopes in service-app-initiated token exchange requests. If exchanging across different custom authorization servers in the same tenant, the issuing AS must be added as a Trusted Server in the receiving AS configuration (Security > API > [auth server] > Trusted Servers).',
        'Step 1: The user authenticates to the application through the normal OIDC or OAuth 2.0 flow. Okta issues an access token scoped to the resources the user is permitted to access. This is the token the user\'s browser or client application holds. At this point, no agent is involved — this is standard authentication.',
        'Step 2: The AI agent — either embedded in the application or operating as a backend service — receives the user\'s access token as the trigger for its task. The user\'s token is the "subject token" in RFC 8693 terminology: it represents whose identity the agent is acting on behalf of. The agent also holds its own credential (an Okta-issued client credential or JWT), which will serve as the "actor token" — proof of the agent\'s own authenticated identity.',
        'Step 3: The agent presents both tokens to the Okta Token Exchange endpoint using the token-exchange grant type. The request includes the subject_token (user\'s access token), the actor_token (agent\'s credential), the requested_token_type (specifying what kind of token is being requested — typically urn:ietf:params:oauth:token-type:access_token), and an audience parameter specifying which downstream API the resulting token is intended for. Okta receives this request, validates both the user\'s token and the agent\'s credential, and evaluates any delegation policies configured for this exchange — checking whether this specific agent is permitted to act on behalf of users for the specified audience.',
        'Step 4: Okta issues a new, scoped access token. This delegated token carries the user\'s identity in the sub claim and the service app\'s client ID in the cid claim — so the downstream API can see both who the user is and which agent made the call. Important technical note: Okta\'s current OBO implementation does not emit the RFC 8693 act (actor) claim as a structured JWT claim. The agent identity is conveyed via cid, not a nested act object. The token\'s scope is constrained to what was explicitly requested and what the agent is authorized to receive — it cannot exceed the user\'s original permissions. This token has its own expiry, is audience-bound to the target API, and is independently revocable.',
        'Step 5: The agent calls the protected API using the delegated token as a standard Bearer token. The API validates the token with Okta and, if it chooses to inspect the delegation claims, can see the full picture: the user who authorized the action, the agent that executed it, the specific scope granted, and the time of issuance. The API can enforce its own policies based on any of these claims — for example, requiring that write operations come only via tokens with an explicit delegation chain. For the SE, this step is the close: "every tool call your agent makes is traceable to the user who authorized it and auditable against your compliance framework."',

        '?? The discovery questions that surface the OBO gap are concrete: "When your AI agent calls an internal API, how does the API know which user authorized that call?" and "What happens if you need to revoke an agent\'s access for a specific user — not all users, just one?" Financial services customers face a "Cartesian product" problem here — each user needs discrete credentials per MCP server, and shared tokens break per-user audit requirements under SOX and FINRA. Both questions expose the same underlying problem. If the agent runs under a shared service account, revoking it kills all users\' agent access simultaneously. If the agent passes the user\'s raw token, there is no delegation record and no way to distinguish "user called this API" from "user\'s agent called this API." If the agent uses client credentials, the API sees only the agent\'s identity with no user context attached. None of these answers are acceptable in a production environment with real compliance requirements.',
        'The key differentiator in this conversation is that OBO Token Exchange in Okta is generally available today — this is not a roadmap item. Prospects evaluating AI agent platforms often encounter solutions where delegated access for agents is still in preview or limited release. Okta\'s implementation is production-ready, based on an IETF standard (RFC 8693), and integrates natively with the authorization policies and token management customers already have configured in their Okta tenant. The adoption path is not "wait for GA" — it is "configure your delegation policy and update your agent\'s token request." Compare this against alternatives: client credentials carry no user context and produce a flat audit trail; JWT profile assertions are non-standard and require custom validation logic at every downstream API; requiring the agent to perform a full re-auth per API call is both operationally fragile and a terrible user experience. OBO is the only standards-based path that solves all three problems simultaneously.',
        'TT The compliance angle deserves its own place in the conversation, especially with security architects and CISO-level stakeholders. OBO-issued tokens are auditable as user-delegated actions, not machine actions. In regulated industries, this distinction matters enormously: GDPR requires that processing of personal data be tied to an identifiable legal basis — user authorization is a valid basis, but "our AI agent accessed your data and we\'re not sure which user triggered that" is not. SOX and HIPAA equivalents require that access to sensitive financial and health records be attributable to authorized individuals. An OBO token exchange record in Okta\'s system log shows: user X authorized agent Y at time T with scope Z. That is the audit evidence the compliance function needs. When the conversation shifts from "how do we connect agents to APIs" to "how do we satisfy our next security review for agentic AI," OBO token exchange is the answer that unlocks the deal.',
